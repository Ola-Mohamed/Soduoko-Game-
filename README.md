# SODUKO GAME Based on C language 

Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid. 
squares. The grid is further divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids.
commonly referred to as "boxes." The objective of the game is to fill 
in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, 
each column, and each box contains all the numbers exactly once.

## Here's a brief overview of how Sudoku is played

1. Initial Setup: A Sudoku puzzle starts with some numbers 
already filled in the grid. These numbers are known as "clues." 
and provide a starting point for solving the puzzle.
2. Number Placement: The player's goal is to fill in the remaining 
empty cells with numbers while following the rules of Sudoku. 
Each row, column, and box must contain all the numbers from 
1 to 9 without repetition.
3. Logic and Deduction: Solving Sudoku involves logical deduction 
and elimination. Players use strategies such as scanning rows, 
columns, and boxes to identify where a particular number can 
be placed based on the existing numbers.
4. Trial and Error: In some cases, logical deduction may not be 
sufficient to determine the next move. Players may need to 
make educated guesses and try out different numbers in a cell 
to see if it leads to a valid solution. If the guess leads to a 
contradiction, it is backtracked, and a different number is tried.
5. Completion: The game is considered complete when all empty 
cells are filled, and the numbers placed satisfy the Sudoku 
rules. A valid Sudoku puzzle should have a unique solution.


#### Sudoku can vary in difficulty, ranging from easy to very challenging.The level of difficulty depends on the number of initial clues provided and the logical complexity required to solve the puzzle.
